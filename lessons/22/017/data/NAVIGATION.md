# Single-structure and ensemble refinement with cryo-EM maps and EMMIVox

## Aims

The aim of this tutorial is to learn how to use PLUMED to perform single-structure and ensemble refinement using cryo-EM maps and EMMIVox.
This lesson was given as part of the PLUMED masterclass series in 2022. It includes:

* A video that explain the theory covered and a second video which shows you how the exercises should be completed.
* Two tutorials that you should try to complete yourself.

## Overview of the theory 

The EMMIVox approach is described in the following publication:

S. E. Hoff, F. E. Thomasen, K. Lindorff-Larsen, M. Bonomi. Accurate model and ensemble refinement using cryo-electron microscopy maps and Bayesian inference.
PLoS Comput. Biol. 20 (2024) e1012180. doi: [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012180](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012180).

## Installation instructions
Prerequisites and guide to install the software to perform EMMIVox simulations can be found [here](install.md).

## Resources

The data needed to complete the tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/maxbonomi/EMMIVox-Plumed-Tutorials). You can clone this repository locally on your machine using the following command:

````
git clone https://github.com/maxbonomi/EMMIVox-Plumed-Tutorials.git  
````

This repository contains the following 2 directories:
* `scripts`: python scripts used for preprocessing and analysis of EMMIVox simulations
* `tutorials`: complete tutorials for single-structure and ensemble refinement

The system under study is a Tau filament resolved at 1.9 Angstrom by the Scheres group
 ([PDB 7P6A](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7P6A), [EMD 13223](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-13223)). The system is composed by 5 identical chains, for a total of 8335 solute atoms.
We will simulate the system using the CHARMM36m force field in explicit TIP3P water, for a total of 40958 atoms. The reference is:
