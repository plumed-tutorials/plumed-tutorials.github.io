# Masterclass 22.07: Learning and enhancing fluctuations along information bottleneck for automated enhanced sampling

This lesson was given as part of the PLUMED masterclass series in 2022.  It includes:

* Two videos that describe the theory. 
* Two python notebooks that describe what you can do using these methods.

The flow chart shown below indicates the order in which you should consult the resources.  You can click on the nodes to access the various resources.  Follow the thick black lines for the best results.  The resources that are connected by dashed lines are supplmentary resources that you may find useful when completing the exercise.

This lesson was the seventh masterclass in the 2022 series.
