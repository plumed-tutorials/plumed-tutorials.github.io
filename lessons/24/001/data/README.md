# README
This guide is designed to provide users with practical advice on using the hySAS module. For theoretical information about the method, please refer to the related [manuscript](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00864). The guide is divided into several sections:

#### hySAS Intro & Overview
A brief introduction to the method, basic concepts, and an overview of the analyses that can be performed.

#### Determining the Scattering Profile with hySAS
From coordinates to a SAS curve: steps and examples to analyse a PDB file or a trajectory.

#### Generating a Conformational Ensemble with GMX and hySAS
Combining GROMACS and PLUMED to generate conformational ensembles restrained by SAS data using different coupling methods.

#### Preparing the Input Files
Guidelines and tips for preparing the input files.

#### Compiling PLUMED with ARRAYFIRE Support
Technical suggestions and a real-case example for installing PLUMED with ARRAYFIRE support on a SLURM-based HPC.
