This repository contains a tutorial on calculating standard binding free energies with Metadynamics through [PLUMED](https://www.plumed.org/) and [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) for the [PLUMED-TUTORIALS](https://www.plumed-tutorials.org/) page. The repository has been structured according to the [contribution instructions](https://www.plumed-tutorials.org/contribute.html) outined by PLUMED. 

Contained in the `ZIPS/` directory as `tutorial.zip` are all the files required to begin and complete the tutorials, which can be downloaded using `curl`:

```
curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' -O -L https://api.github.com/repos/blake-armstrong/binding-tutorial-PLUMED/contents/ZIPS/tutorial.zip
```

Also included in the `ZIPS/` directory is a `reference_data.tar.gz` file which contains all of the output of the tutorial as though someone has completed it from start to finish. This file is hosted on GitHub using the [Large File Storage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) extension. This can also be downloaded with `curl`:

```
