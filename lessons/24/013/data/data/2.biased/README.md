# Biased

This folder contains the biased MD run using PBMetaD and the collective variables (CVs) discovered by PINES.

## Steps

1. **Copy the CV File**: 
   Copy the `plumed_parameterized.dat` file from the `1.NN` folder, which contains the collective variables (CVs) discovered by PINES.

2. **Run Biased MD Simulation**: 
   Execute a biased MD run using PBMetaD with the `plumed_parameterized.dat` file.

3. **Calculate PIV Vector**: 
   Calculate the PIV vector of the biased trajectory to analyze the results.
