# Neural Network Training Directory

This directory contains all necessary files to train a group of Neural Networks. Please note that you will need to provide the training dataset as an `.npy` file and update the relevant paths in the script.

## Steps to Get Started

### 1. Add the Training Dataset
- Place your training dataset as an `.npy` file in this directory.
- Update the paths in `mmd_vae_biased_3HL.py` to point towards your training dataset.

### 2. Create the Environment
- Use the provided `environment.yml` file to create a virtual environment. Run the following command in your terminal:

### 3. Activate the Environment and Run
- bash auto_train.sh >& out.out
