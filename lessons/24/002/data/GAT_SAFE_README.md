# Steps to Run FEP/Plumed Simulations

To run a FEP/Plumed simulation, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the System:**
   - Ensure that your molecular system is correctly prepared.
   - Generate topology and coordinate files.
   - Perform energy minimization and equilibration.

2. **Set Up the Free Energy Perturbation (FEP):**
   - Define the initial and final states of the system.
   - Prepare the necessary input files for the FEP calculation.
   - Specify the lambda values and related parameters.

3. **Integrate with PLUMED:**
   - Write the PLUMED input file using as CVs the dihedrals that undergo trans-cis isomerization for each value of lambda.
   - Define the biasing potential or metadynamics setup in PLUMED.

4. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Use your molecular dynamics software to run the simulation with the PLUMED plugin.
   - Monitor the simulation to ensure it progresses correctly.

5. **Analyze the Results:**
   - Extract and analyze the free energy differences from the FEP simulation.
   - Use PLUMED tools to analyze collective variables and bias potentials.
   - Validate the results by checking convergence and consistency.

6. **Post-Processing:**
   - Visualize the simulation data.
   - Document and interpret the findings.
