<h2>PYTHON_BIN Environment Variable</h2>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
<p>The <code>PYTHON_BIN</code> environment variable tells configure which version of python should be used to construct the PLUMED wrappers. Oftetimes this flag is unecessary
as configure will find any <code>python</code> executable that also has the <code>cython</code> module available automatically. If your python interpreter has a name
that is different from python you will have to set this environment variable.</p>
