This option is useful if you are implementing new funcationality. If it is enabled then PLUMED
is compiled with with various debug flags in place that check if code is workign as it should during
execution. These additional checks will slow down PLUMED, however. In addition, the
full symbol tables will be written in the executable and the final executable will be much larger.
